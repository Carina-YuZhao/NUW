These codes support the Interval-Valued Defuzzification (IVD) methods.
For details on these methods, please refer to our paper: "Effectively Communicating Information and Uncertainty from Fuzzy Sets: Why and How."

The file "demo_syn.R" contains eight different synthetic fuzzy sets along with their IVD results, visualised as presented in the paper.

The scripts "fc_IVDs.R" and "fc_visualisation.R" include functions for calculating and visualising the IVDs.
fc_membership.R contains functions for creating fuzzy membership functions.
